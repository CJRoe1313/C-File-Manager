# C_File_Manager
This is a program I wrote entirely in C. It is a simple file manager that can read files, create new files, or overwrite existing files.

The program will start by asking you what you want to do. Read a file, write a file, or quit the program.

If you choose to read a file, the program will ask you for the file's directory. Once the directory has been entered, the program will check if a file of that name exists in the directory.

If it doesn't, it will show a message saying it was unsuccesful, and the program will bring you back to the options.

If it finds the file, it will show you what is written in the file.

If you decide to write a file, it will also ask you for a directory.

If there is a file at that directory, it will ask you if you want to overwrite the file, and then allow you to type what you want to be on the file.

If there is no file, it will ask you if you want to create a new file at that directory and then also allow yoy type what you want on the file.

I made this program in order to experiment, practice, and get better at the C language by doing something that's slightly out of my comfort zone
